## Visual Branding

### Current Logo
The application uses a geometric cube/diamond SVG logo in purple gradient (#667eea).

**Current SVG**:
```svg
<svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 32 32" fill="none">
    <rect width="32" height="32" rx="8" fill="#667eea"/>
    <path d="M16 8L8 12V20L16 24L24 20V12L16 8Z" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linejoin="round"/>
    <path d="M16 16L8 12M16 16L24 12M16 16V24" stroke="white" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/>
</svg>
```

**Interpretation**: The 3D cube/box design suggests:
- **Structure** - Well-organized code
- **Protection** - Box/container guarding contents
- **Modularity** - Components working together
- **Professionalism** - Clean, geometric design

**Alignment with CodeGuard**: ✅ The protective box/container metaphor aligns perfectly with "Guard" branding.

### Suggested Logo Enhancement (Optional)

To strengthen the "Guard" branding, consider adding a subtle shield element:

```svg
<svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 32 32" fill="none">
    <rect width="32" height="32" rx="8" fill="#667eea"/>
    <!-- Shield outline -->
    <path d="M16 6L10 8V14C10 18 13 21 16 23C19 21 22 18 22 14V8L16 6Z" stroke="white" stroke-width="1.5" fill="none"/>
    <!-- Checkmark inside shield -->
    <path d="M13 14L15 16L19 12" stroke="white" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"/>
</svg>
```

**New Logo Concept**: Shield with checkmark
- **Shield** - Protection, security, guarding
- **Checkmark** - Quality verification, approval
- **Clean Design** - Professional and modern
